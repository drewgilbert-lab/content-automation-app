# Sync start.mdc

Regenerate `.cursor/rules/start.mdc` by reading all files in `docs/` and summarizing the current project state.

## Procedure

1. Read every file in `docs/` (PRD, TECH_DECISIONS, BUSINESS_LOGIC, KNOWLEDGE_BASE, SCOPE, CHANGELOG, API)
2. Rewrite `.cursor/rules/start.mdc` with current facts
3. Preserve `alwaysApply: true` frontmatter

## Constraints

- Must stay under 250 lines total (including frontmatter)
- Written for AI — no filler words, no narrative
- Orientation only: stack, repo structure, module status, detail pointers
- Do NOT duplicate full schema, seed inventory, or API contracts — those live in glob-triggered rules
- Do NOT include changelog history — that lives in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

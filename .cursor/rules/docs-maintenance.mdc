# Doc Maintenance Protocol

After completing a coding task that changes project state, delegate doc updates to a sub-agent using the Task tool. Do NOT read and update docs in the current conversation — preserve context for coding.

## Sub-Agent Prompt Template

Provide the sub-agent with:
1. What changed (files created/modified, new endpoints, schema changes)
2. Which docs to update (from mapping below)
3. Instruction to update "Last updated" date on any modified doc

## Change → Doc Mapping

| Change type | Update |
|---|---|
| New/modified API route | `docs/API.md` |
| New/modified Weaviate collection or property | `docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` |
| New dependency, framework change, or arch decision | `docs/TECH_DECISIONS.md` |
| Content type or context assembly change | `docs/BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` |
| Feature completed or module status changed | `docs/SCOPE.md` |
| New functional requirement or module definition | `docs/PRD.md` |
| New future plan, deferred scope, or phase change | `docs/ROADMAP.md` |
| Any meaningful progress | `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (prepend, newest first) |
